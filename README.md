A searchable archive of Meta's shipped client source. Download a WhatsApp Web
revision, diff it against another, read any module, and trace what depends on what.

WhatsApp Web ships as tens of thousands of minified JavaScript chunks. Each chunk
packs many `__d("ModuleName", [deps], factory, id)` definitions onto a single line.
`cellar` downloads a client revision, parses it with the [oxc](https://oxc.rs) AST,
and writes one file per module, named after the module. The result is a directory
that `grep -r`, your editor, and your coding agent all work on directly.

## Features

- Download and manage source bundles for any past client revision.
- Diff two revisions through a named filter, in JSON, NDJSON, Markdown or text.
- Search modules by name, source text, or exported symbol.
- Print any module's source, dependencies, dependents and exports.
- Build dependency and dependent graphs, as JSON, DOT or Mermaid.
- Serve all of the above to a coding agent over MCP.
- Supports `whatsapp`, `messenger`, `facebook` and `instagram`.

## Requirements

- A recent stable Rust toolchain (1.95 or newer).
- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), which runs the install and CI recipes.
- Around 1.3 GB of disk per indexed revision.

## Installation

Install `just` first:

```bash
brew install just        # macOS
cargo install just       # anywhere Rust works
```

Other options, including Debian, Fedora, Arch, Nix, Scoop and a prebuilt binary,
are in [`just`'s install guide](https://github.com/casey/just#installation).

Then build cellar:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polymorfa/cellar
cd cellar
just install
```

That puts `cellar` at `~/.cargo/bin/cellar`. Make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is on your
`PATH`.

## Documentation

Full documentation, including a worked example that uncovers an unannounced feature
in four commands, is at **[cellar.mintlify.site](https://cellar.mintlify.site)**.

| Page | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [AI assistants](https://cellar.mintlify.site/agents) | MCP setup for Claude Code and Codex, and the sixteen tools |
| [A real example](https://cellar.mintlify.site/walkthrough) | Finding passkey device linking before it shipped |
| [Managing versions](https://cellar.mintlify.site/bundles) | Download, import, inspect and remove releases |
| [Finding code](https://cellar.mintlify.site/search) | Search by name, source or exported symbol |
| [Comparing releases](https://cellar.mintlify.site/diff) | Diffs as text, JSON, NDJSON or Markdown |
| [Graphs](https://cellar.mintlify.site/graph) | Dependency graphs as Mermaid, Graphviz or JSON |
| [Filters](https://cellar.mintlify.site/filters) | Cutting 187,000 modules down to what matters |

Every command also links to its own page from `--help`.

## Project layout

| Crate | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `cellar-core` | Store layout, index model, filter engine, diff, graphs. No I/O beyond the filesystem. |
| `cellar-index` | oxc bundle parsing into a module index. |
| `cellar-fetch` | Revision discovery, download and unpacking. The only crate that reaches the network. |
| `cellar` | CLI and MCP server, both built on one shared operations layer. |

## Development

```bash
just ci        # fmt-check, clippy, tests, skill check
```

No test may reach the network. CI enforces this.
